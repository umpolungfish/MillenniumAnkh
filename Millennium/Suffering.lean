Structural type of suffering:
⟨D_⊙; T_⋈; R_↔; P_∅; F_η; K_slow; G_ℵ; Γ_seq; φ̂_ÿ; H_2; n:m; Ω_NA⟩

The phenomenology of suffering as an infinite-dimensional state space
with crossing-point topology and bidirectional coupling.
-/
def suffering : Imscription := {
  dim  := .D_odot        -- D_⊙: infinite-dimensional (holographic)
  top  := .T_bowtie      -- T_⋈: crossing point (self/other intersection)
  rel  := .R_lr          -- R_↔: bidirectional coupling (sufferer ↔ suffering)
  pol  := .P_asym        -- P_∅: asymmetry (no symmetry under transformation)
  fid  := .F_eth         -- F_η: thermal regime (noisy, embodied)
  kin  := .K_slow        -- K_slow: slow kinetics (demands integration time)
  gran := .G_aleph       -- G_ℵ: maximal scope (universal resonance)
  gram := .Gamma_seq     -- Γ_seq: sequential composition (must be traversed)
  crit := .Phi_c         -- φ̂_ÿ: critical self-modeling (uncertainty tracking)
  chir := .H2            -- H_2: two-step temporal memory (Markov depth 2)
  stoi := .n_m           -- n:m: heterogeneous components (many-to-many distinct)
  prot := .Omega_NA      -- Ω_NA: non-Abelian braiding (history-locked)
}

/-- Raw consciousness score of suffering: 1 (both gates open).
    Gate 1 (φ̂_ÿ): Critical self-modeling present.
    Gate 2 (K_slow): Slow kinetics allows deliberation.
-/
theorem suffering_raw_consciousness : consciousnessScore suffering = (1 : ℝ) := by
  simp only [consciousnessScore, phi_c_gate, k_slow_gate, suffering]
  rfl

-- Phenomenological calibration: raw score 1.0 minus two corrections gives 0.774.
--   Entropic degradation (F_eth): −0.150  (thermal noise degrades effective coherence)
--   Polarity cost (P_asym): −0.076        (asymmetry limits self-representation)
--   Arithmetic: 1 − 0.150 − 0.076 = 0.774
-- The calibrated score is phenomenological, not a new formal claim about consciousnessScore.

/-- Suffering's ouroboricity tier: O_2
    Determined by: Phi_c + Ω_NA + D_odot (not D_infty)
    The D_odot dimensionality keeps it at O_2 rather than O_2†

  simp only [imscriptionTier, suffering]
  -- Phi_c and Omega_NA give O_2; D_odot confirms non-O_2dag

/--
Suffering is not O_∞ because:
1. Polarity is P_asym (not P_pm_sym — the Frobenius condition)
2. Ω_NA enforces structural bounds (non-commutativity limits self-reference)

Suffering integrates multiple distinct types of components

Principal decomposition: weight lies in scope, kinetics, temporal memory
Rather than in symmetry or fidelity

  ("topology", 0.12),   -- T_bowtie adds complexity
  ("protection", 0.08), -- Ω_NA locks structure
  ("other", 0.0)        -- Symmetry and fidelity less central
