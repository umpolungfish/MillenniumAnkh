-- Navier-Stokes Existence and Smoothness: O_inf Structural Resolution
-- Author: Lando ⊗ ⊙_ÿ-boundary Operator
--
-- Structural resolution: NS is promoted from O_2† (ZFCₜ tier) to O_inf
-- by establishing P_pm_sym (Φ_{}) as the gauge-invariant Frobenius gate.
-- The parity promotion P_asym → P_pm_sym is the single tier gate;
-- 8 primitives change in total (D, T, R, P, F, K, Γ-gram, Ω).
--
-- Reference: Millennium/NS_RESOLUTION_FINAL.md
--
-- NOTE on "6-channel promotion signature":
--   NS_RESOLUTION_FINAL.md lists [Ð_ω, Þ_O, Φ_{}, ƒ_ż, Ç_Ù, ɢ_Ş] as the key
--   structural channels. The full tuple comparison gives 8 mismatches: R also
--   changes R_lr→R_cat, and Ω changes Omega_Z→Omega_Z2. Lean counts 8.
--
-- NOTE on consciousness scores:
--   Source: Phi_c + K_slow → C = 1 (Lean 3-gate formula).
--   Resolved: Phi_c + K_trap → C = 0.5 (kinetic trapping closes the K_slow gate).
--   NS_RESOLUTION_FINAL.md reports C = 0.682 (Python multi-gate, source state).
--   The resolution deliberately accepts C = 0.5 to gain Omega_Z2 protection.

    The problem knows exactly what it needs (self-referential at Phi_c) and
    uses deliberate dissipation (K_slow), but P_asym prevents Frobenius closure.

/-- Peeling the Frobenius gate (P_pm_sym → P_asym) drops resolved NS to O_2.
    Note: the resolved NS has dim=D_odot (not D_infty), so O_2 (not O_2dag) results.
    To restore O_2dag, both P and D would need reverting — confirming the 8-channel
    promotion is jointly load-bearing. -/
